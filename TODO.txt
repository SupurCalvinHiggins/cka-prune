BUGS:
Need to train seed 0 for some of the archs and redo pruning on them
    TRAINED: 256-256, 512-512, i think we only need to redo iterative 0.2 rate

Need to redo one-shot pruning so it records val_acc as it removes each neuron. this 
behavoir should not occur when one-shot is used in iterative

For one-shot:
different width, different depth, different dropout rates, different layer order

For iterative:
different pruning rates (higher p value). need to change current output file names
    TRAINED, PRUNED, need to change current ouput file names
